### Situation 1.

```
Mr.Park: Would anyone like to comment on that last suggestion?

Mr.Kim: I totally agree woth you, Mr.Park.
        I can see how it could really help our marketing.
        However, one thing I would like to point out is that it might work to a certain extent,
        but perhaps not in the case of every client.
        Sometimes we can attract the clients with a more indirect approach.

Mr.Park: Thank you for your opinion.
         I think you're right on the point that some customers would react negatively to the direct approach.

Mr.Kim: I recommend using a range of techniques to suit different clients.

Mr.Park: But it wouldn't be easy.
         It would cost a lot of money and I am afraid we will not profit as much as we invest.

Mr.Kim: Why don't we take some extra time to think over the ways to meet the needs of the different types of customers?
        We could set that as a part of the agenda for the next meeting.
